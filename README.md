# chorn's markdown presenter template

This is my working copy of the [MarkdownPresenter](https://github.com/chrishulbert/MarkdownPresenter) project.  I've made a bunch of tiny changes to suit my own needs.  I've been working to these goals:

1. Split up the css, javascript, and html.
1. Change the markup a little.
1. Have local copies of all dependencies so presentations w/o an Internet connection would work.
1. Use the latest [jQuery](http://jquery.org).
1. Use a distribution of [Showdown](https://github.com/coreyti/showdown) that is not abandoned.
1. Make it work with [Pow](http://pow.cx), hence everything stuff in the public/ directory.

## Todo
* Have a few simple css choices for white/black or black/white that are easy to switch on the fly.
* Handle keypress / click events in a broader, better way.
